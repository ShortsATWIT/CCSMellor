Welcome to my FastAPI web app!

This project is an interactive explorer for 15 API routes I created using FastAPI. The routes demonstrate different 
types of web requests such as GET and PUT, and includes query string parameters,
path parameters, and JSON body inputs. The homepage displays clickable links for each route, 
making it easy to test and see how each one works directly in the browser.

I used a few shades of blue in the `styles.css` file to keep the design clean and easy to read (if you can't tell I'm a fan of
blue). Each link opens in a new tab so you can explore the responses one by one.

My favorite part was setting up the route descriptions and seeing everything neatly displayed on the homepage.
