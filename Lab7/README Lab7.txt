Welcome to my FastAPI App!

It includes five GET routes that demonstrate how to retrieve user 
data, track visits, and manage admin access using both headers and 
cookies.

Each route highlights a different way headers or cookies can be 
used in modern web applications. From setting and reading visit 
timestamps to checking user roles and personalized greetings.

My favorite part of this project was experimenting with custom 
headers and cookies to simulate real-world scenarios like user 
tracking and admin access control. It was cool to see how simple 
it is to manage state and identity using FastAPI.
