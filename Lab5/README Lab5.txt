Welcome to my UnitTest!

This project recreates SQL queries from (Lab 4) using 
Python. The goal is to demonstrate how to interact with 
a MySQL database through Python functions and verify 
query results with automated unit tests.

My Lab5 folder contains a set of Python functions in 
Lab5.py that execute the Lab 4 SQL queries on the 
Guitar Shop database. These functions obtain the 
info from many different attributes on the guitar
shop database. The unit tests imports and checks expected 
conditions, such as data types, value ranges, and 
filtering criteria.

My favorite part of the project was successfully 
connecting the database with the Python code. It was 
exciting to combine the database from Dbeaver and the 
Python code from Visual Studio Code.
