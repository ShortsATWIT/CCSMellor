Welcome to my website!

Lab 1:
This is an encyclopedia I created for my cat Audrey. It includes a main page, about page, gallery page, and fun fact page. Each of these pages have different attributes about my cat.

I used a couple different shades of blue inside of styles.css because I thought it made the design look clean, blue is also my favorite color. 

I also included a list on the fun facts page, image printing on gallery, a blockquote on main page, and an article on the about page for a smoother look. My favorite part of this project was creating the table in the fun facts page.

Lab 2:
I added 5 different paths using the new "app.js" file and used "package.json" to automate the process. I was able to get it to run on my laptop through the "localhost:3000" domain.

I have 5 different paths:
http://localhost:3000/about/Audrey: Should bring up "You're viewing the about page for Audrey."
http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Steven: Should bring up "Hello, Steven! Welcome to Audrey's site."
http://localhost:3000/mood/Audrey?mood=sleepy: Should bring up "Audrey is feeling sleepy."
http://localhost:3000/favorites/food: Should bring up "Audrey's favorite food is turkey."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=morning: Should bring up "Audrey naps in the sun."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=night: Should bring up "Audrey hunts for mice."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=: Should bring up "Audrey is probably napping."

My favorite part about this lab was creating the schedule time for the path as it changes depending on what you type into the URL, whether it be morning, night, or something else.
