Welcome to my website!

Lab 2:
I added 5 different paths using the new "app.js" file and used "package.json" to automate the process. I was able to get it to run on my laptop through the "localhost:3000" domain.

I have 5 different paths:
http://localhost:3000/about/Audrey: Should bring up "You're viewing the about page for Audrey."
http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Steven: Should bring up "Hello, Steven! Welcome to Audrey's site."
http://localhost:3000/mood/Audrey?mood=sleepy: Should bring up "Audrey is feeling sleepy."
http://localhost:3000/favorites/food: Should bring up "Audrey's favorite food is turkey."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=morning: Should bring up "Audrey naps in the sun."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=night: Should bring up "Audrey hunts for mice."
http://localhost:3000/schedule?time=: Should bring up "Audrey is probably napping."

My favorite part about this lab was creating the schedule time for the path as it changes depending on what you type into the URL, whether it be morning, night, or something else.
