Welcome to my website!

Lab 1:
This is an encyclopedia I created for my cat Audrey. It includes a main page, about page, gallery page, and fun fact page. Each of these pages have different attributes about my cat.

I used a couple different shades of blue inside of styles.css because I thought it made the design look clean, blue is also my favorite color. 

I also included a list on the fun facts page, image printing on gallery, a blockquote on main page, and an article on the about page for a smoother look. My favorite part of this project was creating the table in the fun facts page.
