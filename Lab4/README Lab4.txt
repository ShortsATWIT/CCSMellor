Welcome to my Guitar Database!

I used the given SQL database and populated it into Dbeaver.
I wrote and executed various SQL queries to retrieve data 
from the my_guitar_shop database.

Each query I wrote looks at specific business needs like 
listing high-value orders or filtering customers by last 
name. This shows how real-world data can be organized and 
queried effectively.

My favorite query was the one that formatted customer names 
as "Last, First" and filtered them based on their last names 
starting with M through Z. I enjoyed combining CONCAT() with 
sorting and filtering logic as it felt like the most practical 
way to visualize the data.
